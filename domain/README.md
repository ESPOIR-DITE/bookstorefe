This package help us to create Objects that are identical to those of Backend object 

_we are using JSON as a type of messaging format. so we have to make sure that the naming conventions are the same in `json:"title"` to the one in the Backend_

_Attention all the variables(`json:"title"`) must be identical and also the Class Name.

_To declare a class in Go you do: type Book struct{}_

_the following is a variable named Title of string type in JSON it will be considered as  `json:"title"`. In Java you do: String title;
Title    string  `json:"title"`
